        - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/78643156.\r\n\r\nWe''re working
        on this with @ZmagoD. \r\n\r\nThere are three main things we are wondering
        about:\r\n\r\n1. How should we make a new template for superadmin? Mail is
        now a model, but we thought there is no sense to create `new` action for mail_template
        controller. Should we make a rake task to generate the first template?\r\n\r\n2.
        The editing field is now just a simple form_field, using simple_format rails
        method to make the text wrapped in html <p> tags and divided with <br> tags.
        However, it''s limited, e.g. it doesn''t let us generate links. \r\nWe found
        some gems, which might allow us to make the editor more ''rich'' - e.g.https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails.
        \r\n\r\n3. We are sure how our new feature will be working with devise_mailer.

        an answer to the task - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111677414.\r\n\r\n1.  Basically,
        what I''ve found out is that Google doesn''t let to set \"subpage results\",
        which they call \"sitelinks\", manually.\r\n\r\n2.  Exact criteria for Google
        algorythms in this area are not public. Nevertheless, there are some sources
        saying what might be done to have this working (without certainty).\r\n\r\n3.
        Here I''ve found information that one of elements that may have influence
        on algorythm is sitemap.xml file - http://bit.ly/1Oc5HXZ. Because of that,
        I''ve added <priority> tag to the sitemap.xml. I understood that you would
        like to have as first two sitelink \"Volunteer\" and \"About Us\", so I gave
        them the highest priority (after root).\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, I''ve changed
        the order of the urls in the sitemap.xml to match the priority.\r\n\r\n5.
        Also, I''ve found that it is posible to demote sitelinks from the results.
        To do that it''s necessary to use the Search Dashboard - as I understand it
        is available to you, @tansaku, as the webmaster. Here you''ll find instructions
        on how to do that exactly: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/47334?hl=en
        , http://www.gsqi.com/marketing-blog/how-to-demote-sitelinks-google-webmaster-tools/\r\n\r\n6.
        I was thinking about changing something in the partial views/layouts/_header.html.erb,
        but I didn''t find any point that could be improved. \r\nI considered hints
        given here (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/47334?hl=en) and
        here (https://www.hochmanconsultants.com/how-to-get-google-sitelinks/).\r\n","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/issues/306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgileVentures/LocalSupport","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/issues/306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/issues/306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/issues/306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/pull/306","id":153448864,"number":306,"title":"generate
